Welcome to the exciting world of adventuring (world name pending).
This adventurers guide is designed to aid those who are unfamiliar with the
rigors of the world they now find themselves in. Within the world itself
there are many ways of learning. Numerous guards will be posted who can
answer questions beginning of those asking for 'help'. Most shopkeepers
are also willing to answer those seeking 'help'.
Key areas will typically be marked with signposts. Also, each adventurer
will be outfitted with a bound copy of the Adventurer's First Steps. One
can 'read' a specific chapter to learn more about it, such as 'combat',
'movement', or 'shopping'. More advanced guidebooks can be purchased at
various bookstores, for a price.

Chapter on Skills and Spells:
Every adventurer starts out knowing a few skills and the occasional spell.
As you gain experience, you can train to improve those skills. New skills
may become available through training, quests, or other sources.
Spells are learned in a similar way, but a spell requires talent in a certain
field of magic. These might be in the form of healing, protection, nature,
conjuration, destruction, or other areas.
The more a skill or spell is trained and used, the more adept the person
becomes at using it. This typically makes it more reliable, more powerful,
and more useful. But it also becomes harder to unlock higher facets of a
skill the more you know about it, up to the point where it is considered
fully mastered.

Spells are broken into (num) schools of magic.
Abjuration: Spells that banish or send away

Alteration: Spells that change the fundamental properties of things.
These spells can affect an items or persons state. 

Conjuration: Spells that call forth astral energy, molding it into a physical
force. These spells may summon creatures from another plane, create objects 
from nothingness, or move people from one location to another. Spells that 
mold astral energy into a physical force.

Divination Spells: Spells that reveal details of an item or person

Enchantment: Spells that enhance the nature of an item or person

Evocation: Spells that cause a physical manifestation of force. These spells
typically involve harming living or non-living things.

Illusion: Spells that involve manipulating the mind and senses of
an enemy. These spells typically confuse or mislead others.

Invocation Spells: Spells that bring an outside force to bear

Mysticism: Spells that unravel the mysteries of the universe, affecting the
laws of nature themselves. 

Necromancy Spells: Spells that effect the life force of a being

Telekinetic Spells: Spells that can move or manipulate objects from a distance
